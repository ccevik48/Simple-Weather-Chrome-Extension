# Simple-Weather-Chrome-Extension
A simple chrome extension for getting the weather

For this chrome extension, the Open Weather Map API is used: https://openweathermap.org/api

To use this extension, download the repository as a zip, then navigate to the popup.js file.
On lines 39 and 101, you must append your API key at the end of the url to get the data.
To get an API key, make a free account at https://openweathermap.org/api and you will receive a key through email.
Since the account is free, you will have access to only certain types of data (i.e. current weather); any other features such as forecasting is for a paid account.

To install the extension, go to chrome extensions page and enable developer mode; select "load unpacked extension" and select the folder containing the files.
